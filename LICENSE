How It Works
The [Your License Name] is a permissive open-source license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute your software with minimal restrictions. When you choose to release your software under this license, you grant anyone the right to:

Use: Others can use your software for any purpose without having to pay for it.

Modify: Others can modify your software and create derivative works.

Distribute: Others can distribute your software, either in its original form or as part of a modified work.

However, there are a few conditions and limitations, such as providing attribution when distributing the software and not using the Licensor's trademarks. The license also includes a disclaimer that makes it clear the software comes with no warranties.

By using this license, you encourage collaboration, sharing, and the growth of your project in the open-source community. Others can build upon your work while respecting your rights and following the terms and conditions specified in the license.

Remember that creating a legal software license may require expertise in legal matters. It's essential to consult with a legal professional to ensure your license meets your specific needs and is compliant with applicable laws.
